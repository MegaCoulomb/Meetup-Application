## Meetup Application

### What
    This is a fictitious event management project, cloning the ReactJS group from Meetup.com.

### Technologies Used
    For this project, I used Javascript, React, styled-components, moment, Google-Maps-API, and the Meetup.com API.

### Play Around!
    Feel free to play around! A user has the ability to ...
    - Join the waitlist, or attend an event. 
    - Add their own information added to the list.
    - View who is attending each event, and who is on the waitlist.
    - Toggle between upcoming React-JS events. Check out the address and map!
